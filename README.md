YOLOv8 is a (YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE version 8) object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It can be effectively used for drone detection in various applications, like security systems for restricted areas. 
There are some process in this like training the model using the drone dataset and downloading all required libraries and pacages as further decribed below in steps:

1.You can simply just download the code and install the necessary packages and use as you like.
2.Main packages are ultralytics and flask(for uploading it on server).
3.In predict.py the drone can be detected by giving video as the input.
4.In predict2.py the drone can be detected by using your camera (opecv package is needed for this). 
5.In multi_predict.py you can give multiple videos for prediction.
6.In flask_predict.py the code will run with index.html and work on local server using webcam.
7.For training the custom dataset use train.py and change configuration.yaml file according to it.
